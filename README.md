## Code Review
- This assignment was kinda difficult because I was having some of issues with it. I had to clone this project like 5 times and netlify isn't really letting me access the admin panel but yeah I guess it was kinda fun making the collections.
- Update: I got the admin panel working thanks to [Jessica](https://github.com/Enyorose). The problem was that I didn't have any external providers so thats why I couldn't get into the admin panel. So yeah I'm so glad thats working now.
